# Binance Smart Chain DeFi Wallet by Trading-Tigers.com 
Hey Tigers,  
Stealth launch, for beta only!

Here is the V2.0 DeFi wallet.
Thanks to all investors!
Using the wallet should be self-explanatory. If you have any questions or problems, please visit our Telegram Channel or open Issue.

Unfortunately, the final status of the wallet is not yet in sight, it works and is usable, but I still have a lot to do here. 

## Briefly on the project:
I learned a lot last year; the wallet has sometimes slipped heavily into the background. Instead, I have focused intensely on the Solidity development, which was a success in my eyes.
Here is also a big thanks to all users of the Sniper Bot, which has given me a lot of helpful feedback and inputs.
The final product of the wallet is still far away, but we said from the beginning that we are a long-term project.  
Big thanks also to Anon for the support in the Telegram channel!
