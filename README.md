# Binance Smart Chain DeFi Wallet by Trading-Tigers.com 
Hey Tigers,  
Stealth launch, for beta only!

Here is the V2.0 DeFi wallet.
Thanks to all investors!
Using the wallet should be self-explanatory. If you have any questions or problems, please visit our Telegram Channel or open Issue.

Unfortunately, the final status of the wallet is not yet in sight, it works and is usable, but I still have a lot to do here.
